# Introduction to Visual HEIFLOW (VHF)
## Description
 Â  VHF is a comprehensive graphical data processing for integrated surface water-groundwater modeling. Its
distinctive features in comparison with existing systems include the following.
-First, VHF uses a generic multivariable-space-time
data cube model, which enables the system to efficiently handle large
time-series datasets over a large spatial domain. 
-Second, VHF streamlines the
entire integrated modeling procedure, from data preparation at the very
beginning to visualization and analysis of modeling results, in a uniform
environment.
-Third, VHF allows updating the land use input at user-specified time points
without manual interruption and therefore enables the model to directly
simulate the hydrological effects of changing land use.
