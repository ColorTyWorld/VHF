==================================

Visual HEIFLOW (VHF) is a comprehensive graphical data processing 
for integrated surface water-groundwater modeling. Its distinctive 
features in comparison with existing systems include the following.

First, VHF uses a generic multivariable-space-time data cube model, 
which enables the system to efficiently handle large time-series 
datasets over a large spatial domain.

Second, VHF streamlines the entire integrated modeling procedure, 
from data preparation at the very beginning to visualization and 
analysis of modeling results, in a uniform environment.

Third, VHF allows updating the land use input at user-specified time
points without manual interruption and therefore enables the model 
to directly simulate the hydrological effects of changing land use.
